      'Sarah baked 35 cookies and wants to put them into bags with 5 cookies in each bag. How many bags will Sarah need?',
    problem_type: 'Division',
    difficulty_level: 'Easy',
    final_answer: 7,
    step_by_step_solution:
      'Sarah has 35 cookies and wants to put 5 cookies in each bag. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total cookies by the number of cookies per bag. 35 divided by 5 is 7. So, Sarah will need <strong>7</strong> bags.',

    problem_type: 'Addition',
    difficulty_level: 'Medium',
    final_answer: 16,
    step_by_step_solution:
      'John starts with 12 apples and gets 7 more, so he has 12 + 7 = 19 apples. Then he eats 3 apples, so we subtract 3 from the total. 19 - 3 = 16. John has <strong>16</strong> apples left.',

    problem_type: 'Multiplication',
    difficulty_level: 'Easy',
    final_answer: 60,
    step_by_step_solution:
      'The garden is a rectangle, and its area is found by multiplying its length by its width. The length is 10 meters and the width is 6 meters. So, the area is 10 * 6 = 60. The area of the garden is <strong>60</strong> square meters.',

    problem_type: 'Addition',
    difficulty_level: 'Medium',
    final_answer: 1,
    step_by_step_solution:
      'Emily has 3/4 of a pizza and David has 1/4 of a pizza. To find out how much they have together, we add their fractions: 3/4 + 1/4. Since the denominators are the same, we add the numerators: 3 + 1 = 4. So, they have 4/4 of the pizza, which is equal to <strong>1</strong> whole pizza.',

    problem_type: 'Multiplication',
    difficulty_level: 'Medium',
    final_answer: 405,
    step_by_step_solution:
      'Each bus can take 45 students, and there are 9 buses available. To find the total number of students that can go, we multiply the capacity of one bus by the number of buses. 45 * 9 = 405. A total of <strong>405</strong> students can go on the field trip.',

    problem_type: 'Subtraction',
    difficulty_level: 'Easy',
    final_answer: 27,
    step_by_step_solution:
      'The video game costs $50, and Mark has already saved $23. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost. $50 - $23 = $27. Mark needs to save <strong>27</strong> more dollars.',

    problem_type: 'Multiplication',
    difficulty_level: 'Hard',
    final_answer: 60,
    step_by_step_solution:
      'The baker has 120 cupcakes, and each needs 1/2 teaspoon of sprinkles. To find the total sprinkles needed, we multiply the number of cupcakes by the amount of sprinkles per cupcake: 120 * (1/2). This is the same as dividing 120 by 2. So, 120 / 2 = 60. The baker needs <strong>60</strong> teaspoons of sprinkles.',

    problem_type: 'Addition',
    difficulty_level: 'Hard',
    final_answer: 7,
    step_by_step_solution:
      'The perimeter of a rectangle is the total length of all its sides added together (2 * length + 2 * width). We know the perimeter is 30 meters and the length is 8 meters. So, 2 * 8 + 2 * width = 30. This means 16 + 2 * width = 30. Subtracting 16 from both sides gives 2 * width = 14. Dividing by 2, the width is <strong>7</strong> meters.',
    hint: 'Remember that a rectangle has two equal lengths and two equal widths.',

    problem_type: 'Addition',
    difficulty_level: 'Medium',
    final_answer: 3,
    step_by_step_solution:
      'Sarah ate 1/3 and her brother ate 1/6. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The smallest common denominator for 3 and 6 is 6. So, 1/3 is the same as 2/6. Now we add 2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6. This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the top and bottom by 3, which gives <strong>1/2</strong>.',
    hint: 'Before you can add fractions, you need to make their bottom numbers the same.',

    final_answer: 8,
    step_by_step_solution:
      'The farmer has 56 sheep and wants to put them equally into 7 pens. To find out how many sheep go in each pen, we divide the total number of sheep by the number of pens. 56 divided by 7 is 8. So, there will be <strong>8</strong> sheep in each pen.',
